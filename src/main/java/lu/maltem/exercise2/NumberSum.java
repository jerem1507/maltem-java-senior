     * We would like this method to sum each digit of the given number.
     * Tips/Hints :
     *      1. Use Recursive call for a better solution.
     *      2. The solution must not take into consideration the sign of the number (the result must always be a positive Integer)
     *
     * It is possible to handle exceptions if requested for a better code quality.
     *
     * Ex :
     * 32 = 3 + 2 = 5
     * -12 = 1 + 2 = 3
     * 476 = 4 + 7 + 6 = 17
     * @param number The number to
     * @return The final sum. Must be a 1-digit output.
